Microsoft Windows Configuration
===============================

The TDDA library makes use of some non-ASCII characters in its output.
In order for these to be displayed correctly on Windows systems, a suitable
font must be used.

Fonts that are known to support these characters on Windows include:

 * ``NSimSun``
 * ``MS Gothic``
 * ``SimSun-ExtB``


Fonts that are known not to support these characters on Windows include:

 * ``Consolas``
 * ``Courier New``
 * ``Lucida Console``
 * ``Lucida Sans Typewriter``

The font for a Command Prompt window can be set through the window's
``Properties``.

Alternatively, the ``--ascii`` flag can be used when using verify or
detect functionality.
