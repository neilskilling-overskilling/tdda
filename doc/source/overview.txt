Overview
========

The :py:mod:`tdda` package provides Python support for
test-driven data analysis
(see `1-page summary <http://stochasticsolutions.com/pdf/TDDA-One-Pager.pdf/>`_
with references, or the `blog <http://tdda.info>`_)

* The :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` library is used to support the creation of
  *reference tests*, based on either :py:mod:`unittest` or :py:mod:`pytest`.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` library is used to *discover* constraints
  from a (Pandas) DataFrame, write them out as JSON, and to *verify* that
  datasets meet the constraints in the constraints file.
  There is also a command-line utility for discovering and verifying
  constraints.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy` library is a tool for automatically
  inferring regular expressions from a column in a Pandas DataFrame
  or from a (Python) list of examples.
  There is also a command-line utility for Rexpy.
