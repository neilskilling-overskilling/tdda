==============

This Version
------------

* **2.2** Improvements to parquet file handling.

* **2.2** Have not (as threatened) removed for feather files yet
  but will shortly, possibly even before 2.3, but a deprecation
  warning has been added that shows when feather files are used.

* **2.2** Added parquet files to various of the examples that users
  get with `tdda examples`

* **2.2** Fixed problem with categorical strings from parquet.

* **2.2** Now use chardet to figure out (infer/guess)  encodings in `gentest`

* **2.2** Added partial support for CSVW metadata (for CSV files)
  and some tests and test data in CSVW format.

* **2.2** Extended support for writing temporary files when tests fails
  from strings/text files to dataframes, CSV files and Parquet files.
  This also means that the dataframe methods can now re-write reference
  results using -W/--write-all etc.

* **2.2** Renamed some methods and parameters for DataFrame assertions
  and comparisons. In particular
   - `assertOnDiskDataFrameCorrect` replaces assertCSVFileCorrect,
     with the path name not being `ref_path` rather than `ref_csv`.
     The old method remains, and calls the new method.
     The new methods works with parquet files as well as with CSV files.
   - `assertOnDiskDataFramesCorrect` replaces assertCSVFilesCorrect,
     with the path name not being `ref_paths` rather than `ref_csvs`.
     The old method remains, and calls the new method.
     The new methods works with parquet files as well as with CSV files.

* **2.2** Better reporting of differences between data frames when
  tests fail or comparisons show differences.

* **2.2** Added experimental `tdda diff` command for comparing data frames
  serialized as parquiet or CSV files.

* **2.2** Add rich dependency and use rich to format dataframe diffs.

* **2.2** Fixed bug in flag parsing that prevented multiple
  single-character flags to be used separately, rather than combined.
  (So `-1W` worked byt -1 -W` did not.)

* **2.2** Fixed bug in the metadata written in constraints files.
  The local and utc times were supposed to be written in ISO8601
  format, but repeated %H in the format string instead of using %M.
  Switched to use `.isoformat()`, and accepted its default `T`
  separator in the datestamps, rather than sticking with space.

* **2.2** Quite a lot of internal refactoring, making parameters
  and methods names more consistent, and better suited to a wider
  variety of file formats and back-end implementations.



Previous Versions
-----------------

* **2.1** Upgrade pandas dependency to 2.0 and significantly
  improve compatibility with Pandas 2.0+.

* **2.1** Add support for parquet files for input and output data,
  (particularly for constraint generation, verification, and detection).
  New dependency on `pyarrow` to support this.

* **2.1** Deprecate use of `.feather` files. Support will be removed
  in a future version, no earlier than 2.2.

* **2.1** Inference of date formats: the TDDA library now uses its
  own methods to infer date formats, as Pandas no longer supports this.

* **2.1** Experimental support for CSV metadata specification files.
  This is unstable, not fully documented, and subject to change.

* **2.0.8 and 2.0.9** Fixed to IP address lookup in `gentest`.

* **2.0** Addition of Gentest---functionality for automatically
  generating Python test code for any command-line program

* **2.0** Major overhaul of documentation.

  - More descriptive documentation
  - Better (though incomplete) separation between user code
    (particularly the command-line utilities ``tdda gentest``,
    ``tdda discover``, ``tdda verify``, ``tdda detect`` and ``rexpy``).
  - Add more external links to resources and fix those that
    had rusted
  - Improve the CSS to make the documentation render better
    on `tdda.readthedocs.io <https://tdda.readthedocs.io>`_
  - Adopt a customized version of the readthedocs theme
    for the documentation everywhere, so that what you see
    if you build the documentation locally should be more
    similar to what you see at
    `tdda.readthedocs.io <https://tdda.readthedocs.io>`_

* **2.0** Significant changes to the algorithm used by Rexpy.
  Should now be faster, but potentially more stochastic.

* **2.0** Rexpy can now generate many different flavours
  of regular expressions.

* **2.0. Planned Deprecation**
  We plan to move from using ``.feather`` files to ``.parquet`` files
  in the 2.1 release, ad which point ``.feather`` files will immediately
  be deprecated.


Older Versions
--------------

* Reference test exercises added.

* Escaping of special characters for regular expressions is now done
  in a way that is uniform across Python2, Python pre-3.7, and Python 3.7+.

* JSON is now generated the same for Python2 and PYthon3 (no blank lines at
  the end of lines, and UTF8-encoded).

* Fixed issue with ``tdda test`` command not working properly in the
  previous version, to self-test an installation.

* Added new option flag ``--interleave`` for :ref:`tdda_detect_tool`.
  This causes the ``_ok`` detection fields to be interleaved with the original
  fields that they refer to in the resulting detection dataset, rather than
  all appearing together at the far right hand side. This option was actually
  present in the previous release, but not sufficiently documented.

* Fix for the ``--write-all`` parameter for :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest`
  result regeneration, which had regressed slightly in the previous version.

* Improved reporting of differences for text files in
  :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` when the *actual* results do not match the
  *expected* file contents.
  Now fully takes account of the ``ignore`` and ``remove`` parameters.

* The ``ignore_patterns`` parameter in
  :py:meth:`~tdda.referencetest.referencetest.ReferenceTest.assertTextFileCorrect()` (and others)
  in :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` now causes only the portion of a line that
  matches the regular expressions to be ignored; anything else on the line
  (before or after the part that matches a regular expression) must be
  **identical** in the *actual* and *expected* results.
  This means that you are specifying the part of the line that is allowed to
  differ, rather than marking an entire line to be ignored.
  This is a change in functionality, but is what had always been intended.
  For fuller control (and to get the previous behaviour),
  you can anchor the expressions with ``^.*(...).*$``, and then they
  will apply to the entire line.

* The ``ignore_patterns`` parameter in :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` can now
  accept grouped subexpressions in regular expressions. This allows use of
  alternations, which were previously not supported.

* The ``ignore_substrings`` parameter in
  :py:meth:`~tdda.referencetest.referencetest.ReferenceTest.assertTextFileCorrect()` (and others)
  :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` now only matches lines in the *expected*
  file (where you have full control over what will appear there), not in
  the *actual* file.
  This fixes a problem with differences being masked (and not reported as
  problems) if the *actual* happened to include unexpected matching content
  on lines other than where intended.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package is now more resilient against
  unexpected type mismatches. Previously, if the type didn't match, then
  in some circumstances exceptions would be (incorrectly) raised for other
  constraints, rather than failures.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package now supports Python ``datetime.date``
  fields in Pandas DataFrames, in addition to the existing support of
  ``datetime.datetime``.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` Python API now provides support for in-memory
  constraints, by allowing Python dictionaries to be passed in to
  :py:meth:`~tdda.constraints.verify_df` and
  :py:meth:`~tdda.constraints.detect_df`,
  as an alternative to passing in a ``.tdda`` filename.
  This allows an application using the library to store its constraints
  however it wants to, rather than having to use the filesystem
  (e.g. storing it online and fetching with an HTTP ``GET``).

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package can now access MySQL databases using
  the `mysql.connector <https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python>`_
  driver, in addition to the
  `MySQLdb <https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python>`_ and
  `mysqlclient <https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient>`_ drivers.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy` tool can now *quote* the regular expressions it
  produces, with the new ``--quote`` option flag. This makes it easier to
  copy the expressions to use them on the command line, or embed them in
  strings in many programming languages.

* The Python API now allows you to ``import tdda`` and then refer to its
  subpackages via ``tdda.referencetest``, ``tdda.constraints``
  or ``tdda.rexpy``.
  Previously you had to explicitly import each submodule separately.
