Recent Changes
==============

This Version
------------

* Added new option flag ``--interleave`` for :ref:`tdda_detect_tool`.
  This causes the ``_ok`` detection fields to be interleaved with the original
  fields that they refer to in the resulting detection dataset, rather than
  all appearing together at the far right hand side. This option was actually
  present in the previous release, but not sufficiently documented.

* Fix for the ``--write-all`` parameter for :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest`
  result regeneration, which had regressed slightly in the previous version.


Older Versions
--------------

* Improved reporting of differences for text files in
  :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` when the *actual* results do not match the
  *expected* file contents.
  Now fully takes account of the ``ignore`` and ``remove`` parameters.
  
* The ``ignore_patterns`` parameter in
  :py:meth:`~tdda.referencetest.referencetest.ReferenceTest.assertTextFileCorrect()` (and others)
  in :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` now causes only the portion of a line that
  matches the regular expressions to be ignored; anything else on the line
  (before or after the part that matches a regular expression) must be
  **identical** in the *actual* and *expected* results.
  This means that you are specifying the part of the line that is allowed to
  differ, rather than marking an entire line to be ignored.
  This is a change in functionality, but is what had always been intended.
  For fuller control (and to get the previous behaviour),
  you can anchor the expressions with ``^.*(...).*$``, and then they
  will apply to the entire line.

* The ``ignore_patterns`` parameter in :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` can now
  accept grouped subexpressions in regular expressions. This allows use of
  alternations, which were previously not supported.

* The ``ignore_substrings`` parameter in
  :py:meth:`~tdda.referencetest.referencetest.ReferenceTest.assertTextFileCorrect()` (and others)
  :py:mod:`tdda.referencetest` now only matches lines in the *expected*
  file (where you have full control over what will appear there), not in
  the *actual* file.
  This fixes a problem with differences being masked (and not reported as
  problems) if the *actual* happened to include unexpected matching content
  on lines other than where intended.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package is now more resilient against
  unexpected type mismatches. Previously, if the type didn't match, then
  in some circumstances exceptions would be (incorrectly) raised for other
  constraints, rather than failures.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package now supports Python ``datetime.date``
  fields in Pandas DataFrames, in addition to the existing support of
  ``datetime.datetime``.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` Python API now provides support for in-memory
  constraints, by allowing Python dictionaries to be passed in to
  :py:meth:`~tdda.constraints.verify_df` and
  :py:meth:`~tdda.constraints.detect_df`,
  as an alternative to passing in a ``.tdda`` filename.
  This allows an application using the library to store its constraints
  however it wants to, rather than having to use the filesystem
  (e.g. storing it online and fetching with an HTTP ``GET``).

* The :py:mod:`tdda.constraints` package can now access MySQL databases using
  the `mysql.connector <https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python>`_
  driver, in addition to the
  `MySQLdb <https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python>`_ and
  `mysqlclient <https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient>`_ drivers.

* The :py:mod:`tdda.rexpy` tool can now *quote* the regular expressions it
  produces, with the new ``--quote`` option flag. This makes it easier to
  copy the expressions to use them on the command line, or embed them in
  strings in many programming languages.

* The Python API now allows you to ``import tdda`` and then refer to its
  subpackages via ``tdda.referencetest``, ``tdda.constraints``
  or ``tdda.rexpy``.
  Previously you had to explicitly import each submodule separately.
