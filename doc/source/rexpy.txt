The ``rexpy`` command
---------------------

::

    rexpy [FLAGS] [inputfile [outputfile]]

If ``inputfile`` is provided, it should contain one string per line;
otherwise lines will be read from standard input.

If ``outputfile`` is provided, regular expressions found will be written
to that (one per line); otherwise they will be printed.

``FLAGS`` are optional flags. Currently:

  ``-h``, ``--header``
    Discard first line, as a header.

  ``-?``, ``--help``
    Print this usage information and exit (without error)

  ``-g``, ``--group``
    Generate capture groups for each variable fragment
    of each regular expression generated, i.e. surround
    variable components with parentheses, e.g.

        ``^[A-Z]+\-[0-9]+$``

    becomes

        ``^([A-Z]+)\-([0-9]+)$``

  ``-q``, ``--quote``
    Display the resulting regular expressions as
    double-quoted, escaped strings, in a form broadly
    suitable for use in Unix shells, JSON, and string
    literals in many programming languages. e.g.

        ``^[A-Z]+\-[0-9]+$``

    becomes

        ``"^[A-Z]+\\-[0-9]+$"``

  ``--portable``
     Product maximally portable regular expressions
     (e.g. [0-9] rather than \d). (This is the default.)

  ``--grep``
     Same as ``--portable``

  ``--java``
    Produce Java-style regular expressions (e.g. ``\p{Digit}``)

  ``--posix``
    Produce posix-compilant regular expressions
    (e.g. ``[[:digit:]]`` rather than ``\d``).

  ``--perl``
    Produce Perl-style regular expressions (e.g. ``\d``)

  ``-u`` ,  ``--underscore``  Allow underscore to be treated as a letter.
    Mostly useful for matching identifiers
    Also allow ``-_``.

  ``-d``, ``--dot``
    Allow dot to be treated as a letter.
    Mostly useful for matching identifiers.
    Also ``-.`` and ``--period``.

  ``-m``, ``--minus``
    Allow minus to be treated as a letter.
    Mostly useful for matching identifiers.
    Also ``--hyphen`` or ``--dash``.

  ``-v``, ``--version``
    Print the version number.

  ``-V``, ``--verbose``
    Set verbosity level to 1

  ``-VV``, ``--Verbose``
    Set verbosity level to 2

  ``-vlf``, ``--variable``
    Use variable length fragments

  ``-flf``, ``--fixed``
    Use fixed length fragments
