Gentest: Automatic Test Generation for Unix & Linux Commands/Scripts
====================================================================

Gentest is experimental functionality to generate tests automatically
for any shell command from Linux- and Unix-type systems.
(This functionality is not tested on Windows, and probably does not work.)

``tdda gentest``
----------------

To run the gentest wizard (recommended in most cases), use::

    tdda gentest

Alternatively, you can supply parameters directly on the command line::

    tdda gentest  'quoted shell command' [test_outputfile.py] [reference files]]

You can use ``STDOUT`` and ``STDERR`` (with any capitalization) to
those streams, which will by default not be checked. You can also add
``NONZEROEXIT`` to the command line indicate that a non-zero exit code
is expected, so should not prevent test generation.

.. note::
   THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS CURRENTLY EXPERIMENTAL (IN BETA).
