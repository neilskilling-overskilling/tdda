master:

  master.

  What we push to PyPI always comes from master, but not all changes
  to master are immediately pushed to PyPI.

  We only use pushv when we intend to push to PyPI, and when we actually
  do that we also tag the release with 'v%s' % versionnumber.

dev:

  Most new work should happen on this branch and only be merged
  onto master when we are ready to release it for the world on Github.

rexless:

  This branch attempts to speed up rexpy through two main mechanisms:

    1. Not using regular expressions in figuring out what the pattern are
    2. Working on samples that get expanded when necessary.

regexformats:

  Initial experiment to support different kinds of regular expressions,
  e.g.

    - portable
    - perl
    - posix ...

gentest:

    Automatic test generation.

algorithm:

    Branch for documenting the rexpy algorithm.
