R Examples for Gentest
======================

These scripts and datasets are closely based on examples provided by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency data at
<https://www.epa.gov/caddis-vol4/download-r-scripts-and-sample-data>

In order to use them, you need a functioning installation of `r`
with the packages `gam` and `bio.infer` installed.
Those can be installed using the script `00-install-packages.R`.

The scripts have been:
* renamed with numbers to indicate the order in which to run them
* modified to run the setup scripts `0-set-variables.R`, required
  for them to work
* Scripts 3 and 4 have been modifed to write the plots they produce
  to PostScript files.
